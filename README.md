# factory_pattern_design
A simple implementation of the factory design pattern

First, the project includes a car interface that defines a speed method.The speed method takes in 1 parameter; int mileage.

A few implementations of this interface that return an object of car type : VolvoImpl, TruckImpl and BentleyImpl(I dont know much about cars..lol)

A factory class that takes the car type as an argument and returns the appropriate implementation of this interface.
